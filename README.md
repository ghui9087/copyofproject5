<h2>
This is place for planning
</h2>
<p>
So I am thinking that we can have struck like this
</p><p><h3>
University class: 
</h3><li>
Has two Unorder_map. One content the map<Course number, Course object>. One is student map<Student ID(int), Student object>
</li></p><p><h3>
  Course class:
</h3><li>
  Has one Unorder_map, one integer for Course Number, One String for Course Information. Map will be like map/</Student ID(int), Student object">"
</li></p><p>
